MscSCEP client library for iOS 
==============================
Open-source implementation of [Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol][1]. 
Version: 1.0.0

Requirements
------------
MscSCEP requires iOS 5.0 and above.

User third-party open-source library:
 - [OpenSSL][2]

Only **Foundation.framework** must be linked into the application for proper compilation.

Linker flags must be set:

 1. -ObjC
 2. -all_load

***ARC***
The entire codebase of MscSCEP use Automatic Reference Counting. If you are including the MscSCEP sources directly into a project that does not yet use Automatic Reference Counting, you will need to set the -fobjc-arc compiler flag on all of the MscSCEP source files.


Quick start guide
-----------------
Short examples for the implemented SCEP functions

#### Download CA certificate (GetCACert operation)
To communicate with the SCEP server the client needs the certificate of SCEP server.

```objc
NSError* error; //MscSCEP informs you about the errors via NSError
NSString* documentPath = [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) objectAtIndex:0]; //path for the document directory
MscSCEP* scepClient = [[MscSCEP alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://teszt.e-szigno.hu/scep"]]; //initialize client library with the URL of scep server
NSArray* caCertificates = [scepClient downloadCACertificate:&error]; //download the certificate(s)
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
}
MscCertificate* caCertificate = [caCertificates objectAtIndex:0]; //operation was successful, take the first certificate
NSString* caCertificateePath = [documentPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"caCertificate.cer"]; //path for the certificate
[caCertificate saveToPath:caCertificateePath error:&error]; //save certificate to the given path
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
}
```

The number of certificates depends on the type of SCEP server. If the client directly communicates with the CA, the array should contain only one certificate. In case where a RA exist, the array can contain multiple certificate. For other SCEP operations you should use the first certificate in the array. 

#### Certificate Enrollment (PKCSReq operation)
To request a certificate the client needs a RSA key and a self-signed certificate.

```objc
NSError* error; //MscSCEP informs you about the errors via NSError
NSString* documentPath = [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) objectAtIndex:0]; //path for the document directory
    
MscSCEP* scepClient = [[MscSCEP alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://teszt.e-szigno.hu/scep"]]; //initialize client library with the URL of scep server
    
MscRSAKey* rsaKey = [[MscRSAKey alloc] initWithKeySize:KeySize_2048 error:&error]; //generate a new RSA key. It can be 2048 or 4096 bit long
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
}

MscCertificateSubject* subject = [[MscCertificateSubject alloc] init]; //initialize a certificate subject with the given common name and country. You can specify the following attributes: common name (CN), locality name (L), state or province name (ST), organization name (O), organizational unit name (OU), country name (C), street address (STREET), domain component (DC) and user identifier (UID).
subject.commonName = @"MscSCEP tester";
subject.countryName = @"HU";

//initiliaze a certificate signing request with the following parameters
MscCertificateSigningRequest* csr = [[MscCertificateSigningRequest alloc] initWithSubject:subject //subject
                                    rsaKey:savedRSAkey //rsa key
                                    challengePassword:@"testclient" //challenge passowrd 
                                    fingerPrintAlgorithm:FingerPrintAlgorithm_SHA256 error:&error]; //fingerprint algorithm. It can be MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
}

//initialize a self-signed certificate with the following parameters 
MscCertificate* certificate = [[MscCertificate alloc] initWithRequest:csr //certificate signing request 
                                rsaKey:rsaKey //rsa key 
                                error:&error];
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
}

//request (enrol) a certificate with the following parameters
MscSCEPResponse* response = [scepClient enrolWithRSAKey:rsaKey //rsa key
                        certificateSigningRequest:csr //certificate signing request 
                        certificate:certificate //self-signed certificate
                        caCertificate:caCertificate //ca certificate which you can take with the downloadCACertificate function
                        createPKCS12:YES //with YES you can get the certificate and the PKCS12 object as well
                        pkcs12Password:@"123456" //password for PKCS12 
                        error:&error]; 
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
}

if (response.pkiStatus == SCEPPKIStatus_PENDING) { //check response status
    [response pollWithError:&error]; //PENDING means, that the request pending for manual approval , try it again later
    if (nil != error) {
        NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
    }
    if (response.pkiStatus == SCEPPKIStatus_SUCCESS) { //If SUCCESS, save certificate and pkcs12 to document directory
        MscCertificate* cert = [response.certificates objectAtIndex:0]; //enrolled certificate and the full certificate chain
        NSString* enrolledCertificatePath = [documentPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"enrolledCertificate.cer"]; //path to certificate
        [cert saveToPath:enrolledCertificatePath error:&error]; //save it to the given path
        if (nil != error) {
            NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
        }
        
        MscPKCS12* pkcs12 = response.pkcs12; //pkcs12 object
        NSString* pkcs12Path = [documentPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"pkcs12.pfx"]; //path to pkcs12
        [pkcs12 saveToPath:pkcs12Path error:&error]; //save it to the given path
        if (nil != error) {
            NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
        }
    }
}
```


#### Certificate Access (GetCert operation)
According to the SCEP specification, the client does not have to store its own certificate, it can download it from the server if the serial number and the issuer of certificate is known. 

```objc
NSError* error; //MscSCEP informs you about the errors via NSError
NSString* documentPath = [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) objectAtIndex:0]; //path for the document directory
NSString* rsaPath = [documentPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"rsa.key"]; //path for your saved RSA key
MscRSAKey* rsaKey = [[MscRSAKey alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:rsaPath error:&error]; //initialize a rsa key instance with the path of key
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
}

MscSCEP* scepClient = [[MscSCEP alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://teszt.e-szigno.hu/scep"]]; //initialize client library with the URL of scep server
[scepClient downloadCertificateWithRSAKey:rsaKey //your RSAKey
            issuer: issuer //issuer of your certificate (MscCertificateSubject instance)
            serial: serial //serial number of your certificate
            caCertificate:caCertificate //ca certificate which you can take with the downloadCACertificate function
            error:&error];
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
}
```

#### CRL Access (GetCRL operation)
To download a certificate revocation list the client needs a RSA key, a certificate (it can be self-signed) and needs to know the serial number and the issuer of the related certificate 

```objc
NSError* error; //MscSCEP informs you about the errors via NSError
NSString* documentPath = [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) objectAtIndex:0]; //path for the document directory
NSString* rsaPath = [documentPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"rsa.key"]; //path for your saved RSA key
MscRSAKey* rsaKey = [[MscRSAKey alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:rsaPath error:&error]; //initialize a rsa key instance with the path
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
}
NSString* certificatePath = [documentPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"certificate.cer"]; //path for your certificate
MscCertificate* certificate = [[MscCertificate alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:certificatePath error:&error]; //initialize a certificate instance with the path
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
}

MscSCEP* scepClient = [[MscSCEP alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://teszt.e-szigno.hu/scep"]]; //initialize client library with the URL of scep server

[scepClient downloadCRLWithRSAKey:rsaKey //your RSAKey
            certificate: certificate //your certificate
            issuer: issuer //issuer of the related certificate (MscCertificateSubject instance)
            serial: serial //serial number of the related certificate
            caCertificate:caCertificate //ca certificate which you can take with the downloadCACertificate function
            error:&error];
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"error occured: %d", error.code); //check NSError
}
```
